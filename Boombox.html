    <p>On October 7th of 2021, a user named carl92 on watzatsong.com posted a song and asked for help identifying the song. He quickly ruled out other songs in the comments and answered an inquiry about where he recorded the audio from. Carl states he doesn't remember where he recorded it from and that the file was found in a DVD backup for an older computer. The boombox commonly associated with the song came from when Youtuber Jay Kay uploaded the snippet of the song to his Youtube channel with the pink boombox picture.</p><br>

    <p>The hunt has resulted in multiple false leads and theories. One theory suggests the song was made for a TV commercial in the 80s. This was reached by some searchers due to the fact the audio has a 15.734 kHz pilot tone, something only in MTS broadcasts within a select few countries or found on foreign CRT TVs tuned into a North American station. But this also means the song could have been recorded from anything on a CRT TV, not just a commercial. However, people still search through 80s commercial compilations with the hope they'll find it.</p><br>
    <p>Another popular theory is that the song is from a non-English speaking country due to how the singer pronounces words. Searchers commonly shift through different Asian 80s pop songs and artists with the hope the song will show up there.</p><br>
    <p>This song was discovered thanks to the website Reddit! Back in July of 2023 Reddit user HeyScarlett checked the songwriters' database (known as Songview) and found 4 songs between the years 1984 and 1988 matching the title of "Ulterior Motives" or "Everyone Knows That." The four songwriters listed were: The Booth Brothers, Marcelo Romero, Michael Barragan, and a group of songwriters led by Preston Glass. All were contacted about if they were responsible for the song.</p><br>
    <p>Of the contacted... Only Preston Glass replied and stated his group was not responsible. However, this lead was not a dead end as the user who discovered this looked into The Booth Brothers, specifically Christopher Booth, to discover that his style of music was a good match to the song and that he also made songs under the name Christopher Saint. Looking into his Christopher Saint name it was discovered that he made music for a particular genre of film... Adult films.</p><br>
    <p>On April 27th of 2024 user One-Truth-5867 found a clip from a Christopher Saint song on YouTube (the clip has been removed from YouTube) and it sounded extremely close to the missing song, so they submitted it as a tip to another user, south_pole_ball. From here south_pole_ball began looking through all adult films with music credited to Christopher Saint. In the early morning hours of the following day, the song was discovered (in full) in one of these adult films. Someone extracted the audio and cleaned it up before posting it to YouTube, marking this as a found song (and safe to listen to)!</p>
